# MineSweeper

##### Instructions:

Minesweeper consists of a board of squares, some containing bombs. If you click on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you manage to click all the squares without clicking on any bombs you win.  Clicking a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring squares containing bombs.

###### Note:
Some game functionality is yet to be finished.  

###### Features to be added:

* Right clicking to defuse bomb.
* Tracking for score and high score.
